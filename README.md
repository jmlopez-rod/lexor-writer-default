Lexor Language: Lexor default style writer
==========================================

The goal of this style is to take any file, treat it as HTML and
write it in the lexor format. The lexor format is still being
developed. It will essentially be derived from Markdown, Kramdown,
pandoc and other preprocessors out there.
